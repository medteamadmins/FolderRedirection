Folder Redirection for Downloads, Documents, and Desktop

These are the scripts needed to get Microsoft Intune to create and map new Desktop, Downloads, and Documents on computers.

You upload FolderRedirectionDownload.ps1 to Intune as a script. That will in turn download KnownFolderPathPS5.ps1 and FolderRedirection.ps1 and set the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents to the new path.
